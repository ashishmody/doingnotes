Feature: add and update notes
  In order to write things down
  As a user
  I want to add and update notes
  
  Scenario: add a note
  Given an outline with the title "Songs"
    And a first note with the text "Misirlou" and the id "1234" for "Songs"
    And I save
  When I go to the start page 
    And I follow "Songs" 
    And I hit "enter" in a note textarea with id "1234"
  Then I should see "Misirlou" in a note li
    And "1234" should have no child notes
    And the new note li should be blank
    And I should see "2" notes
  When I refresh 
  Then I should see "Misirlou" in a note li
    And "1234" should have no child notes
    And the new note li should be blank
    And I should see "2" notes
